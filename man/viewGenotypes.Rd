\title{
Print Genotypes to the Console
}
\description{
\code{viewGenotypes} prints a tab-delimited table of samples, loci, and
alleles to the console so that genotypes can be easily viewed.
}
\usage{
viewGenotypes(object, samples = Samples(object), loci = Loci(object))
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
An object of
  one of the \code{gendata} subclasses, containing genotypes to be
  viewed.
}
  \item{samples}{
A numerical or character vector indicating which samples to display.
}
  \item{loci}{
A numerical or character vector indicating which loci to display.
}
}
\details{
\code{viewGenotypes} is a generic function with methods for
\code{genambig} and \code{genbinary} objects.

For a \code{genambig} object, a header line indicating sample, locus,
and allele columns is printed.
Genotypes are printed below this.  Genotypes are ordered first by locus
and second by sample.

For a \code{genbinary} object, the presence/absence matrix is printed,
organized by locus.  After the matrix for one locus is printed, a blank
line is inserted and the matrix for the next locus is printed.
}
\value{
No value is returned.
