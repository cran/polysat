\title{
Calculate Probabilities of Unambiguous Genotypes
}
\description{
Given an ambiguous genotype and either a data frame of allele
frequencies or a vector of genotype probabilities,
\code{genotypeProbs} calculates all possible unambiguous genotypes and
their probabilities of being the true genotype.
}
\usage{
genotypeProbs(object, sample, locus, freq = NULL, gprob = NULL,
              alleles = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
An object of class \code{"genambig"}.  The \code{Ploidies} and
\code{PopInfo} slots must be filled in for the sample and locus of interest.
}
  \item{sample}{
Number or character string indicating the sample to evaluate.
}
  \item{locus}{
Character string indicating the locus to evaluate.
}
  \item{freq}{
A data frame of allele frequencies, such as that produced by
\code{\link{simpleFreq}} or \code{\link{deSilvaFreq}}.  This argument
should only be provided if the selfing rate is zero.
}
\item{gprob}{
  A vector of genotype probabilities based on allele frequencies and
  selfing rate.  This is generated by \code{\link{meandistance.matrix2}} and
  passed to \code{genotypeProbs} only if the selfing rate is greater
  than zero.
}
\item{alleles}{
  An integer vector of all alleles.  This argument should only be used
  if \code{gprob} is also being used.
  }
}
\details{
This function is primarily designed to be called by
\code{meandistance.matrix2}, in order to calculate distances between all
possible unambiguous genotypes.  Ordinary users won't use
\code{genotypeProbs} unless they are designing a new analysis.

The genotype analyzed is \code{Genotype(object, sample, locus)}.  If
the genotype is unambiguous (fully heterozygous or homozygous), a single
unambiguous genotype is returned with a probability of one.

If the genotype is ambiguous (partially heterozygous), a recursive
algorithm is used to generate all possible unambiguous genotypes (all
possible duplications of alleles in the genotype, up to the ploidy of
the individual.)

\bold{If the \code{freq} argument is supplied:}

The probability of each unambiguous genotype is then calculated from
the allele frequencies of the individual's population, under the
assumption of random mating.  Allele frequencies are normalized so that
the frequencies of the alleles in the ambiguous genotype sum to one;
this converts
each frequency to the probability of the allele being present in more
than one copy.  The product of these probabilities is multiplied by the
appropriate polynomial coefficient to calculate the probability of the
unambiguous genotype.

\deqn{p = \prod_{i=1}^n f_{i}^{c_i} * \frac{(k-n)!}{\prod_{i=1}^n c_i!}}{
      p = \prod_(i=1)^n f_i^(c_i) * (k-n)!/(\prod_(i=1)^n c_i!)}

    where \emph{p} is the probability of the unambiguous genotype, \emph{n}
    is the number
of alleles in the ambiguous genotype, \emph{f} is the normalized frequency of
each allele, \emph{c} is the number of duplicated copies (total number of
copies minus one) of the allele in the unambiguous genotype, and \emph{k} is
the ploidy of the individual.

\bold{If the \code{gprob} and \code{alleles} arguments are supplied:}

The probabilities of all possible genotypes in the population have
already been calculated, based on allele frequencies and selfing rate.
This is done in \code{meandistance.matrix2} using code from De Silva
\emph{et al.} (2005).
Probabilities for the genotypes of interest (those that the ambiguous
genotype could represent) are normalized to sum to 1, in order to give
the conditional probabilities of the possible genotypes.

\value{
  \item{probs }{A vector containing the probabilities of each unambiguous
    genotype.}
\item{genotypes }{A matrix.  Each row represents one genotype, and the
  number of columns is equal to the ploidy of the individual.  Each
  element of the matrix is an allele.}
